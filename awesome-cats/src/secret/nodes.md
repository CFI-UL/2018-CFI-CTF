# My notes

## PHP 

> https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/php/

```
<?php // PHP code must be enclosed with <?php tags

// If your php file only contains PHP code, it is best practice
// to omit the php closing tag to prevent accidental output.

// Two forward slashes start a one-line comment.

# So will a hash (aka pound symbol) but // is more common

/*
     Surrounding text in slash-asterisk and asterisk-slash
     makes it a multi-line comment.
*/
